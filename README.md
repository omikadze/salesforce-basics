# Salesforce Basics
## Salesforce User Basics

### Welcome to Salesforce

Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud. 

So what does that really mean? Well, before Salesforce, your contacts, emails, follow-up tasks, and prospective deals might have been organized something like this:

It’s hard to get the full picture of your prospective customer. And you certainly can’t access the data from anywhere, anytime, nor can your manager or executives see your progress on deals in flight.

Salesforce takes all of that important data and organizes it into a simple user interface. It’s one place for you to:

* Manage all your contacts
* Work with your prospective customers
* Organize tasks and to-do items
* Focus on the right deals
* Collaborate with your team
* Showcase your big wins
* Close more business

And because it’s stored on our secure cloud, you can access your data anytime, anywhere, whether you’re on desktop or mobile.

### Who sees what

Access determines your ability to open and interact with data stored in Salesforce. The data you can create, view, edit, and delete is determined by settings your admin maintains. Access can be simple or multilayered, depending the complexity of your company’s needs. The important thing you need to know is that Salesforce has options for who can see and edit data, and your admin helps to set these up and maintain them.
With the right security enabled, your whole company can be on Salesforce, and one of the best reasons to do that is to harness the power of collaboration.

### Collaboration using Salesforce

In addition to technology for managing your sales process, Salesforce includes a platform for collaboration. You can create groups, follow people and topics, ask questions, post informal polls, share files and links, and mention colleagues with whom you’d like to connect. You can also ask questions and get answers, crowdsourcing expertise from across your company. You can find experts who can help you with overcoming objections as they come up. You can search for competitive information to help you through the negotiation stage. You can get help from your leaders and teammates as you work on steps to close.

But perhaps the best part about collaborating in Salesforce is that it’s all stored for future reference. Rather than having key insights and answers to important questions living in individual email inboxes or in hallway conversations, collaboration in Salesforce is accessible and searchable. 

And because it’s in Salesforce, this is collaboration that can happen in context, right on individual deals, tasks, support issues, and more. This is the power of collaboration combined with CRM.

### What Is CRM?

CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. This technology allows you to manage relationships with your customers and prospects and track data related to all of your interactions. It also helps teams collaborate, both internally and externally, gather insights from social media, track important metrics, and communicate via email, phone, social, and other channels.

In Salesforce, all of this information is stored securely in the cloud.

### How Salesforce Organizes Your Data

Salesforce organizes your data into objects and records. You can think of objects like a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data.

In Salesforce, objects are accessed via the navigation menu. Select any record to drill into a specific account, contact, opportunity, or any other record in Salesforce.

So, that’s objects, records, and more, and now you have some insight into how your data is organized in Salesforce using our spreadsheet example. But unlike an actual spreadsheet, your Salesforce data is stored in our trusted, secure cloud and has an easy-to-use interface, which you can access both from the desktop and your mobile device. So it’s similar to a spreadsheet, but in Salesforce, your data is all tracked, shared, and has apps connected to it. Salesforce comes with a set of standard objects already set up and ready for use.

### Salesforce Standard Objects
Here are some of the core standard objects you’ll be using with Salesforce, and a description of how each one is used.

* Accounts are the companies you’re doing business with. You can also do business with individual people (like solo contractors) using something called Person Accounts.
* Contacts are the people who work at an Account.
* Leads are potential prospects. You haven’t yet qualified that they are ready to buy or what product they need. You don’t have to use Leads, but they can be helpful if you have team selling, or if you have different sales processes for prospects and qualified buyers.
* Opportunities are qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert the Lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.

Salesforce CRM allows you to manage and access your data in sophisticated ways that you could never do with a simple spreadsheet. Your records can be linked together to show how your data is related, so you can see the whole picture.

## Get Started with Commerce Cloud

### What Is Commerce Cloud?

Commerce Cloud is a key part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform and offers ecommerce solutions for B2C (business to consumer) and B2B (business to business) customers. That means that organizations purchase Commerce Cloud to provide the best ecommerce websites to their customers who are shopping online—whether they are consumers buying the latest fashion or businesses making a large wholesale purchase.

Commerce Cloud was created in July 2016, when Salesforce acquired Demandware, an industry leader in ecommerce sites and solutions designed with the shopper in mind. The Demandware technology has grown and evolved to become the Salesforce B2C Commerce product.

In 2018, Commerce Cloud expanded beyond B2C ecommerce with the acquisition of CloudCraze, a leader in ecommerce designed for organizations selling to business customers. What was CloudCraze is now the Salesforce B2B Commerce product.

Now Commerce Cloud spans across B2C and B2B to offer leading ecommerce solutions for all types of companies looking to sell products and services online.

### What Are the Commerce Cloud Products and Capabilities?

Commerce Cloud features two core capabilities: B2B Commerce and B2C Commerce.

#### B2B Commerce
Consumers aren’t the only ones buying online. Businesses need to make purchases too. For example, a wholesaler can place an order of merchandise to stock multiple stores for an entire season, or a factory can purchase replacement parts for a specific type of machine. B2B Commerce powers sites for many of the world’s largest companies that span manufacturing, consumer goods, technology, healthcare, and more.

These sites are designed for extremely large carts and purchases consisting of hundreds or thousands of items. They include B2B-specific functionality such as:

* Authenticated sites, including logins for each visitor
* Shopping carts that can accommodate hundreds of items per order
* Two-click reorders to make large, frequent orders fast and easy
* Custom storefront themes for a unique look and feel for each account
* Specific product catalogs by account for a selected subset of products
* Negotiated/contract pricing by account or by customer segment
* Complex shipping functionality allowing for multiple delivery dates and locations
* Multiple payment types like credit card, purchase order, and ACH
