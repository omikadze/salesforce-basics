# Salesforce Basics
## Salesforce User Basics

### Welcome to Salesforce

Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud. 

So what does that really mean? Well, before Salesforce, your contacts, emails, follow-up tasks, and prospective deals might have been organized something like this:

![GitHub Logo](/photo1.png)

It’s hard to get the full picture of your prospective customer. And you certainly can’t access the data from anywhere, anytime, nor can your manager or executives see your progress on deals in flight.

Salesforce takes all of that important data and organizes it into a simple user interface. It’s one place for you to:

* Manage all your contacts
* Work with your prospective customers
* Organize tasks and to-do items
* Focus on the right deals
* Collaborate with your team
* Showcase your big wins
* Close more business

And because it’s stored on our secure cloud, you can access your data anytime, anywhere, whether you’re on desktop or mobile.

### Who sees what

Access determines your ability to open and interact with data stored in Salesforce. The data you can create, view, edit, and delete is determined by settings your admin maintains. Access can be simple or multilayered, depending the complexity of your company’s needs. The important thing you need to know is that Salesforce has options for who can see and edit data, and your admin helps to set these up and maintain them.
With the right security enabled, your whole company can be on Salesforce, and one of the best reasons to do that is to harness the power of collaboration.

### Collaboration using Salesforce

In addition to technology for managing your sales process, Salesforce includes a platform for collaboration. You can create groups, follow people and topics, ask questions, post informal polls, share files and links, and mention colleagues with whom you’d like to connect. You can also ask questions and get answers, crowdsourcing expertise from across your company. You can find experts who can help you with overcoming objections as they come up. You can search for competitive information to help you through the negotiation stage. You can get help from your leaders and teammates as you work on steps to close.

But perhaps the best part about collaborating in Salesforce is that it’s all stored for future reference. Rather than having key insights and answers to important questions living in individual email inboxes or in hallway conversations, collaboration in Salesforce is accessible and searchable. 

And because it’s in Salesforce, this is collaboration that can happen in context, right on individual deals, tasks, support issues, and more. This is the power of collaboration combined with CRM.

### What Is CRM?

CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. This technology allows you to manage relationships with your customers and prospects and track data related to all of your interactions. It also helps teams collaborate, both internally and externally, gather insights from social media, track important metrics, and communicate via email, phone, social, and other channels.

In Salesforce, all of this information is stored securely in the cloud.

### How Salesforce Organizes Your Data

Salesforce organizes your data into objects and records. You can think of objects like a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data.

![GitHub Logo](/photo3.png)

In Salesforce, objects are accessed via the navigation menu. Select any record to drill into a specific account, contact, opportunity, or any other record in Salesforce.

So, that’s objects, records, and more, and now you have some insight into how your data is organized in Salesforce using our spreadsheet example. But unlike an actual spreadsheet, your Salesforce data is stored in our trusted, secure cloud and has an easy-to-use interface, which you can access both from the desktop and your mobile device. So it’s similar to a spreadsheet, but in Salesforce, your data is all tracked, shared, and has apps connected to it. Salesforce comes with a set of standard objects already set up and ready for use.

### Salesforce Standard Objects
Here are some of the core standard objects you’ll be using with Salesforce, and a description of how each one is used.

* Accounts are the companies you’re doing business with. You can also do business with individual people (like solo contractors) using something called Person Accounts.
* Contacts are the people who work at an Account.
* Leads are potential prospects. You haven’t yet qualified that they are ready to buy or what product they need. You don’t have to use Leads, but they can be helpful if you have team selling, or if you have different sales processes for prospects and qualified buyers.
* Opportunities are qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert the Lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.

Salesforce CRM allows you to manage and access your data in sophisticated ways that you could never do with a simple spreadsheet. Your records can be linked together to show how your data is related, so you can see the whole picture.

## Get Started with Commerce Cloud

### What Is Commerce Cloud?

Commerce Cloud is a key part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform and offers ecommerce solutions for B2C (business to consumer) and B2B (business to business) customers. That means that organizations purchase Commerce Cloud to provide the best ecommerce websites to their customers who are shopping online—whether they are consumers buying the latest fashion or businesses making a large wholesale purchase.

Commerce Cloud was created in July 2016, when Salesforce acquired Demandware, an industry leader in ecommerce sites and solutions designed with the shopper in mind. The Demandware technology has grown and evolved to become the Salesforce B2C Commerce product.

In 2018, Commerce Cloud expanded beyond B2C ecommerce with the acquisition of CloudCraze, a leader in ecommerce designed for organizations selling to business customers. What was CloudCraze is now the Salesforce B2B Commerce product.

Now Commerce Cloud spans across B2C and B2B to offer leading ecommerce solutions for all types of companies looking to sell products and services online.

### What Are the Commerce Cloud Products and Capabilities?

Commerce Cloud features two core capabilities: B2B Commerce and B2C Commerce.

#### B2B Commerce
Consumers aren’t the only ones buying online. Businesses need to make purchases too. For example, a wholesaler can place an order of merchandise to stock multiple stores for an entire season, or a factory can purchase replacement parts for a specific type of machine. B2B Commerce powers sites for many of the world’s largest companies that span manufacturing, consumer goods, technology, healthcare, and more.

These sites are designed for extremely large carts and purchases consisting of hundreds or thousands of items. They include B2B-specific functionality such as:

* Authenticated sites, including logins for each visitor
* Shopping carts that can accommodate hundreds of items per order
* Two-click reorders to make large, frequent orders fast and easy
* Custom storefront themes for a unique look and feel for each account
* Specific product catalogs by account for a selected subset of products
* Negotiated/contract pricing by account or by customer segment
* Complex shipping functionality allowing for multiple delivery dates and locations
* Multiple payment types like credit card, purchase order, and ACH

#### B2C Commerce

B2C Commerce lets brands create and coordinate shoppers’ online experiences and transactions across digital channels and devices. Web and mobile sites are a huge part of the online experience. Brands can launch and manage responsive ecommerce sites—for web and mobile—that have rich online storefronts, shopping cart and checkout functionalities, and full customization capabilities.

For many retailers, one site isn’t enough. When retailers have more than one brand, or when they sell in multiple countries, they typically need different sites for each brand and geography. Commerce Cloud lets retailers launch sites for multiple brands and geographies and then manage them all in a single place.

But shoppers don’t just visit web and mobile sites, they also interact with brands through email, social media, and in stores. By integrating their ecommerce sites with their marketing and service solutions, brands can make every email and social media interaction more personalized and relevant to shoppers. And by bringing ecommerce into the store through kiosks or store associate application they can provide shoppers with improved service and access to more inventory than what is available in store, often helping to “save the sale!”

##### Einstein for B2C Commerce
Einstein for B2C Commerce features are directly embedded into B2C Commerce to empower marketers and merchandisers to use AI without having to hire a data scientist. Using the wealth of their commerce data, they now have the power to make smarter decisions and supercharge personalization across commerce journeys.

Einstein intelligence powers five key B2C Commerce capabilities: Einstein Product Recommendations, Einstein Predictive Sort, Einstein Commerce Insights, Einstein Search Dictionaries, and Einstein Search Recommendations.
  
##### Order Management for B2C Commerce
Order Management for B2C Commerce gives brands full visibility into orders and inventory data. Self-service tools for shoppers, and smart up-sell and cross-sell opportunities for service agents inspire shopper loyalty and drive revenue for companies.

With Order Management, merchants can leverage the extensibility of the Salesforce Platform to design complex processes with flow, and connect effortlessly to logistics partners via the AppExchange and MuleSoft. This gives companies the flexibility to ship from anywhere, creating efficiencies that save time and money.

##### Endless Aisle for B2C Commerce
Endless Aisle for B2C Commerce provides brands with physical stores the ability to offer shoppers limitless product choice and eliminate lost sales by extending digital commerce into the store. Brands can offer to sell and ship any product to their customers, regardless of its location—helping to deliver product faster and more cost effectively. And brands can also empower store associates with real-time access to digital inventory.


### Why Does Commerce Cloud Need Different Products for B2B and B2C Commerce?

Commerce sites built for business users (B2B) are designed for a smaller set of known customers who often make large or frequent purchases. For example, a chemical manufacturer can sell to 1,000 factories that reorder each month. B2B sites need to make it easy for customers to make large orders, and then reorder the right products quickly.

Commerce sites built for the consumer (B2C)—the kind that all of us use for regular online shopping—are designed to attract a large number of guest shoppers to the site. Once a shopper is on the site, companies want to show them the most relevant products, let them quickly add a few (or several!) products to their cart, and then pay and finish the transaction quickly. It’s important for B2C sites to scale for big sales or holidays when millions of shoppers can be on the site at the same time.

### The Key Categories of B2C Commerce

B2C Commerce is broken down into these categories:

* Commerce Storefront
* Merchandising and Marketing
* Multi Site Management and Localization
* B2C Commerce Extensions

#### B2C Commerce Storefront

The B2C Commerce storefront is essentially an ecommerce site. But it’s so much more than just a website with an online cart. Brands can differentiate, manage, and customize shoppers’ ecommerce experience.

Capabilities include the Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA), a robust reference architecture that helps brands build and launch sites quickly and easily using mobile-first best practices. While each site has its own feature-rich storefront, retailers can use the reference architecture to create it. It sits outside the platform API layer and is fully customizable. It lets you create storefronts that support multiple languages and currencies. It provides a modern shopping cart and checkout that features Save for Later (to save an item to a wishlist for a logged in user), optimized user flows, Apple Pay, and other wallet options to make the checkout process as fast and seamless as possible.

Capabilities also include prebuilt integrations to extend site functionality, and open APIs so that your site can connect to any third-party data or applications like user reviews.

#### Merchandising and Marketing

Merchandising and Marketing capabilities in B2C Commerce draw on the power and insights of AI, giving retailers limitless opportunities for personalized engagement with their customers. These capabilities help brands fuel ecommerce growth with features that empower:

* Product, pricing, and catalog management, so that marketers and merchandisers can sync products and pricing across categories, catalogs, currencies, and sites
* Merchandising and promotion management, to quickly launch campaigns and promotions
* Site search and guided navigation that help online shoppers zero in on the perfect product
* Faster AI-powered personalization that uses machine learning to deliver personalized offers and product recommendations

#### Multi Site Management and Localization

Global retail brands need unique, localized sites for each market. B2C Commerce is a leader in internationalization and helps customers easily create and manage additional, geo-specific sites that encompass different customs, cultures, currencies, and languages. For example, a retailer focusing on the United States, France, and Germany is most likely to have a unique website dedicated to each country. Brands can target their content, offers, and products by language, country, region, state, or city.

Multi Site Management also empowers regional marketing teams with a global reference storefront that lets them build and launch sites quickly with multi-lingual, multi-currency logic. Plus, user interfaces are available in English, Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, Korean, and Portuguese

#### B2C Commerce APIs

B2C Commerce APIs take brands beyond the website to use digital capabilities across social, mobile, and even in-store channels. These include:

* APIs to connect with third-party applications
* Social media extensions, to extend commerce into social channels and online communities, such as Instagram and Facebook
* In-store endless aisle and “clienteling,” to help in-store shoppers find the item they need, even if it’s not available at that specific store location. (This is a reference app that uses B2C Commerce customer, product, and inventory data to enable store associates to access this information to complete sales in the store.)

### Einstein for Commerce

Einstein for Commerce features are directly embedded into Salesforce B2C Commerce to delight shoppers, make merchants more productive, and most importantly—grow revenue. This is all achieved through AI and machine learning, using their own wealth of commerce data.

#### Einstein Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations uses machine learning to make suggestions personalized to a consumer’s shopping experience. Whether a shopper is a guest or known—that is, signed in to an account—these recommendations suggest the most relevant products throughout a consumer’s shopping journey to keep them engaged on the web site, and help them browse more efficiently.

Merchants can choose from multiple recommendation types. They can use traditional recommendations that show like-for-like products, for example, where a shopper sees blue shoes recommended on a product detail page for another pair of blue shoes.
Einstein Product Recommendations present customers with the right products at the right time. They encourage more purchases and maximize a brand’s revenue. But they do something else that’s just as important, if less quantifiable. They offer each customer a delightful shopping experience through personalized—perhaps even thoughtful—attention to their interests, based on the items they themselves have shown interest in.  And happy shoppers are good for business.

#### Einstein Predictive Sort

With Einstein Predictive Sort, brands can automatically personalize the order of products shown on each search results or category page. This means products most relevant to a shopper show up first based on their past browsing and buying behavior. Predictive Sort makes the web experience more enjoyable since shoppers don’t have to scroll through as many products and pages to find items of interest.

It’s even more impactful for shoppers using a mobile device. Mobile screens typically show fewer products per page, and shoppers don’t like to click and scroll through several pages to find what they’re looking for. Einstein Predictive Sort is a simple way to make the mobile shopping experience faster and more seamless.

#### Einstein Search Recommendations

Einstein Search Recommendations powers personalized type ahead search guidance for each individual shopper on site. This Google-ifys the brand’s site search so that shoppers are automatically guided to the best search terms for them.

For example, if one shopper starts to type the letter s, she might see the word sandals autocomplete for her. This is based on her past shopping and browsing history. If another shopper types the letter s, he might see the word sneakers autocomplete based on his history.

#### Einstein Commerce Insights

Einstein Commerce Insights empowers merchandisers to interpret purchasing behavior using a powerful shopping basket analysis dashboard. Merchandisers can choose key items in their inventory and learn which products shoppers most commonly purchase along with them. Merchandisers can drill into data on specific products based on date range, and gain insight into metrics such as product-specific sales and top “co-purchase” categories.

#### Einstein Search Dictionaries

Einstein Search Dictionaries consumes all the site searches and surface terms that are used in searches, but not yet in the retailer’s keyword list. It then makes recommendations to merchandisers, for example, synonyms that can be added to the list. Before, if retailers wanted to find missing search terms and pick the synonyms list to add them to, they had to sift through a long spreadsheet and guess which one they wanted.

Einstein Search Dictionaries analyzes data across B2C Commerce to find relationships between search terms, and then recommends the synonym list to add them to. For example, a shopper searching for “mauve sweater” might not get any results. But Einstein Search Dictionaries, seeing a potential relationship—mauve being sort of pink—will recommend adding “mauve” to the synonym list for “pink” and “purple.” Now, a shopper looking for a "mauve sweater" might see exactly what they want. The benefits for shoppers and retailers are clear. Shoppers aren’t disappointed, coming away empty-handed when they can’t find the stuff they want. Retailers benefit in multiple ways: by not losing a sale to a customer who can’t find what's actually in stock, and by reducing some of their workload so they can focus on other important site merchandising tasks.

### Learn About Commerce Cloud Order Management

Order Management for B2C Commerce gives retailers an all-inclusive view of customers, orders, returns and exchanges, inventory, products, and promotions across physical and digital channels. This feature helps retailers process orders and optimize their inventory—and so much more.

If you’ve bought anything online, you probably relied on an order management system when you checked on your order or even looked up previous orders. But Order Management also drives more complex, “cross-channel” transactions. Have you ever bought something online and then picked it up in the store? Or returned to a store an item you bought online? You were engaging in a cross-channel transaction, a shopping experience that is becoming more and more popular with consumers.

Order Management, an add-on to B2C Commerce, shares order data in real time with B2C Commerce. That's why it's "for B2C Commerce!"


#### Capabilities of Commerce Cloud Order Management for B2C Commerce

* Enterprise Inventory

At the core of every successful shopping experience is an accurate view of the inventory that’s available for sale. Enterprise Inventory makes all available inventory visible—whether it's in stores or in distribution centers—in a single, authoritative available-to-sell record. So all selling and service channels have an accurate representation of sellable inventory no matter where it sits. This makes more units of inventory available to shoppers, rather than just the units sitting in an individual area or store. It also prevents over sells, which can frustrate consumers and retailers alike.

* Distributed Order Management

The Order Management engine, sometimes called Distributed Order Management, encompasses all of the sophisticated logic that it takes to allocate items, fulfill an order and manage the entire order life cycle. This baked-in intelligence means retailers can accept orders and returns from multiple selling channels—online, mobile, in-store. Retailers can process invoices, payments, and sales tax. And it lets retailers set allocation rules for backorders, preorders, split orders, and drop-ship orders to ensure each and every one is fulfilled cost-effectively and efficiently.

* Store Fulfillment

Mobile optimized, real-time tools for retailers let store associates quickly and easily handle fulfillment requests that are ready for shipment. The Store Fulfillment feature also enables retailers to have products at the ready for a customer who wants to pick items up in-store.

* Customer Service

The customer service features of Order Management enable universal order intervention. From any channel—phone, web, store, even customer self-serve—customer service reps have a complete view of shoppers, the product catalog, inventory, and orders. So reps and associates can provide the best possible service when they handle order inquiries or modifications.

* Complete Order Data

With Order Management, retailers have access to order information at all stages of the process, from where and how the order was generated to where and how it is being delivered. This gives retailers more control and visibility into each individual unit of merchandise from the moment of purchase to the moment of delivery.

### Learn About B2B Commerce

While Salesforce B2C Commerce focuses on online retail shoppers, there’s another whole area of ecommerce with its own demands and capabilities—B2B—business to business.

Salesforce B2B Commerce enables organizations to create ecommerce storefronts that are specifically designed for businesses making large volume purchases from other businesses online. B2B commerce customers need easy online access to suppliers so they can buy products to run their businesses.

After you earn this badge, you’ll better understand what your stakeholders—partners, admins, developers, and merchandisers—are talking about when they talk about B2C Commerce.

We build B2C Commerce storefront applications with the shopper in mind. We want shoppers to get what they want, return again and again, and tell their friends and family what a great experience they had. Providing an online shopping experience that’s fun, fast, and easy makes everyone happy.

#### The Shopper’s View

Let’s say you’re treating yourself to a tropical vacation next month. You’ve done a little surfing on other vacation trips, and you’re curious about riding the waves in a new location. Maybe you’ll discover when you get there that the waves are a tad out of your league. Maybe you’ll go to nice quiet reef instead and play with the tropical fish and the green sea turtles.

Whatever you do, you’re going to have a great time, and you need some fabulous gear!

You take a deep breath, log in to your smartphone or computer, and open a cool site called BeachCloud that sells beach products.

You click the Apparel tab, then the tile that says Bathing Suits. There are other tabs, such as Accessories, but you ignore those for now.

Like many B2C Commerce storefronts, the BeachCloud site organizes products by category, and each category has a tab. When you click a tab to see products in that category, you’re navigating the site.

You don't see what you want, so you enter stripd bathing suit into the search field. Woops, typo!

But then you see a page that asks if you really meant “striped bathing suit.” And there’s a link.

This is called searching.

You click the link and a pink striped bathing suit displays on the very first page. It’s just what you’re looking for.

You hover your mouse over the image and it zooms in, showing more details. You’re viewing product content.

You click a video link and see a model wearing the suit and moving so you can see it from different angles. The video is also content.

The suit looks just right. You select your size and click Buy.

Now you’re on a roll. You click the Accessories tab and see tiles for footwear, towels, and sunglasses. You click the Towels tile and select a big, thirsty-looking towel with bright stripes, then click Buy.

You spy a panel at the top of the page that says, “All Surfboards Half Off.”

This is a promotion with a fabulous discount.

It’s your lucky day. You click the panel to open a page showing a whole lot of surfboards. You pick one with red and pink stripes and click Buy.

You go back to your cart and view your new list, which now includes the flip-flops.

You didn't know it when you made your original choices, but the bathing suit comes with a free bag. There’s a link to choose the bag you want beneath the bathing suit line item. You click the link, pick the yellow bag, and click Choose. Your bag is now listed beneath the bathing suit in the cart.

Checkout is fast and easy.

You enter your name and address, click Same as Billing, enter your credit card information, and select a shipping method. Because you’re in no rush, BeachCloud waives the shipping fee. Your order looks great, and you have free shipping. You’re happy. You click Place Order.

You’re back at the front page and you spy a pair of goggles. It’s too late to add to your order now, but maybe you’ll add the goggles to your wish list. You wonder if you should create a BeachCloud account so you get more cool deals that help you save up for your next vacation.

People who create accounts at an ecommerce site can log in whenever they shop there. Logged-in shoppers have special privileges like wish lists and saved payment information that save them time and make them feel special.

Now, all you have to do is start packing for your trip.

### B2C Commerce Features

Lots of retail companies sell their products online—in fact most do. But finding the right tools and services to make ecommerce dreams come true can be daunting. That’s where B2C Commerce comes in. What is B2C Commerce, and how can you relate it to what you already know about online shopping?

![Photo](./photo4.png)

B2C Commerce is a set of tools, services, and processes that you use to configure ecommerce sites. Whether your customers are browsing on their desktop or a mobile device, we’ve got you covered. It’s about product details that help shoppers make decisions, targeted discounts, speedy checkout, and underlying tools that track behavior and data. Lots of features come standard, and the B2C Commerce open development environment lets you customize or extend it further.

In B2C Commerce, a site is the application and associated code that runs a storefront, where shoppers go to buy things online. You can sell your products internationally if you want, because B2C Commerce data and storefronts are localizable. B2C Commerce supports both language- and country-specific locales.

If you create or maintain B2C Commerce sites, you’re probably a merchandiser, administrator, or developer. Merchandisers create marketing campaigns and work with site data such as product details, images, and search. Administrators configure sites and make sure they run properly. Developers develop the sites. This module is designed mainly for merchandisers, but if you’re an admin or a developer, you’ll find information here that’s helpful for you, too.

Let’s start by learning about the B2C Commerce standard features: search, navigation, product, content, discounts, logged-in users, and checkout. You configure these features in Business Manager, an online B2C Commerce tool for anyone who creates and maintains B2C Commerce sites.

![Photo](./photo5.png)

#### How Shoppers Find Your Stuff and Navigate Your Storefront

Good ecommerce search and navigation help shoppers find what they want fast. You want shoppers to find what they’re looking for, buy it, and keep coming back.

Here are some key terms you should know.

* Keyword Search—The shopper types a word in the search field.
* Search Suggestion (aka search-as-you-type)—After the shopper types the first few letters of a word, B2C Commerce displays a list of clickable suggestions.
* Search Results—The site displays clickable product tiles or a list of products that fit the search criteria.
* Navigation—The shopper clicks tabs or breadcrumbs to get closer to the products they want.
* Storefront Sorting—The shopper selects from a menu to change which products appear first in the search results.
* Search Refinement—The shopper selects price range, color, and size to narrow the search.
* No Results Found—This page opens when there are no results.

![Photo](./photo6.png)

#### How You Showcase Your Products

While search is where a shopper types text into a search field to find something, navigation is when they click on category tabs or select subcategories to navigate the site. In the BeachCloud storefront we talked about in the previous unit, our imaginary shopper clicked the Accessories (category) tab and then the Footwear (sub-category) tile.

![Photo](./photo7.png)

B2C Commerce organizes sites using categories. A catalog is a container for categories, and a category is a container for products. Each product is identified by an SKU or part number. Other information about the product includes size, color, specifications, brand, price, graphics, and videos. Videos are typically supported outside B2C Commerce, such as with a content delivery network (CDN).

You can configure products as masters and variants. For example, each variant of the master product can specify a unique size and color, with corresponding graphics.

![Photo](./photo8.png)

Product sets are where your shoppers can buy a group (set) of products or individual products in the set. For example, they can order a wardrobe—pants, shirt, and hat—all together or separately. Product bundles are multiple products that are orderable only as a unit, such as a gaming bundle that includes a video game console and several games.

#### How Shoppers Compare Your Products

After searching for an item, shoppers see a search results page where they can click a tile or an item in a list.

![Photo](./photo9.png)

To make it easy for shoppers to compare products, the product details are consistent. Graphics and video are in the same place, the list of product information has the same format and information types, and pictures display in standard sizes. Consistency improves your shoppers' experience because they can focus on the differences between products, not the difference between page elements.

#### How You Give Shoppers a Discount

Getting a discount feels awesome! You use Business Manager to create all kinds of discounts for your customers. Start by creating qualifiers, then promotions, and then campaigns.

A qualifier is a condition that shoppers must meet to be eligible for a discount. These are qualifiers.

* Coupons support direct marketing efforts. You can create single-use coupons and coupons that shoppers can use more than once.
* Customer groups can be a list of specific customers or customers that meet certain criteria such as age and geographic location.
* Source codes are available via a link on an affiliate website. Shoppers search on one site, click a link, and are directed to another site. A qualifier code in the cookie provides the discount at the second site.

In Business Manager, you can create three types of promotions.

* Product—Give shoppers a free or discounted product.
* Order—Give shoppers a discount on their order.
* Shipping—Give shoppers a discount or an upgrade on shipping.

A B2C Commerce campaign contains one or more experiences that shoppers have in your storefront. In this module, we focus on the promotion experience. You can create a spring campaign, for example, that offers 10% off on pants, 20% off orders over a specified amount, and free shipping. You configure each discount in a promotion, then configure each promotion as an experience within a campaign.

#### How You Reward Logged-In Users

Shoppers who create an account on your ecommerce site and log in when they shop are loyal buyers. You can reward their loyalty by giving them special discounts or providing services such as wish lists, gift registries, detailed order history, and delivery tracking. You can also store credit card data and addresses so logged-in shoppers can check out and pay faster.

#### How Your Shoppers Check Out

After shoppers select the items they want to buy, they check out and pay for their purchases. This process should be easy and fast.

![Photo](./photo10.png)

Helping your shoppers check out fast means collecting key information from them as painlessly as possible. B2C Commerce lets you do that by minimizing the number of pages in your checkout flow and the number of buttons or links a shopper has to click—anything that can detract from the buying experience and prevent a sale.

#### Third Party Integrations

B2C Commerce comes with all the standard features we’ve looked at so far in this module. Through the Salesforce B2C Commerce LINK Technology Program, B2C Commerce also integrates with third-party applications that handle processes such as tax calculation, shipping carriers, and payment providers.

## Salesforce B2C Commerce for Merchandisers ( Configure product listings, make them easy to find, and give shoppers discounts they love. )

### B2C Commerce Product Data

In this unit, we discuss how catalogs, categories, products, content, and libraries work in your organization’s B2C Commerce storefront.

A quick word about organizations, sites, and storefronts. Your organization contains your sites, and each of your sites can contain one or more storefronts. Your organization can have:

* One site with one storefront
* One site with multiple storefronts
* Multiple sites and multiple storefronts

#### Catalogs

A catalog is a collection of categories, products, and images. Your company can have one or many catalogs. You can only assign one catalog—the storefront catalog—to your site.

![catalog](./photo11.png)

When we talk about sites in B2C Commerce, we mean the application and associated code and configurations that represent one or more storefront URLs. Storefront is the term we use for a B2C Commerce website, but we also use the term to describe any online ecommerce experience, such as a native application on a mobile device. A storefront is the place shoppers go to buy stuff!

In the storefront catalog, the category structure you create determines storefront navigation: the categories that group products, the products available in each category, and the product attributes displayed to the shopper.

Product attributes are the information types you define for each product. For example, product attributes for shoes include size, color, heel height, width, and brand. When you define attributes for the Shoes category, all products in that category have those attributes.

If you want to manage your products in a catalog with the same structure as an external system or system of record, you create a standard catalog, which you don’t assign to a site. A standard catalog owns the products (that means you edit products in the standard catalog) and mirrors the organization of your inventory, fulfillment, or product management systems.

![catalog](./photo12.png)

Catalog A is the standard catalog, while Catalog B is the storefront catalog. They both contain the same product IDs, but they have different categories. Catalog A categories are from the system of record. Catalog B categories display on the storefront.

You don’t have to create your data in Business Manager. You can import data such as product details, inventory, prices, content, images, and video from another system.
