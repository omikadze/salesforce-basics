# Salesforce Basics
## Salesforce User Basics

### Welcome to Salesforce

Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud. 

So what does that really mean? Well, before Salesforce, your contacts, emails, follow-up tasks, and prospective deals might have been organized something like this:

It’s hard to get the full picture of your prospective customer. And you certainly can’t access the data from anywhere, anytime, nor can your manager or executives see your progress on deals in flight.

Salesforce takes all of that important data and organizes it into a simple user interface. It’s one place for you to:

* Manage all your contacts
* Work with your prospective customers
* Organize tasks and to-do items
* Focus on the right deals
* Collaborate with your team
* Showcase your big wins
* Close more business

And because it’s stored on our secure cloud, you can access your data anytime, anywhere, whether you’re on desktop or mobile.

### Who sees what

Access determines your ability to open and interact with data stored in Salesforce. The data you can create, view, edit, and delete is determined by settings your admin maintains. Access can be simple or multilayered, depending the complexity of your company’s needs. The important thing you need to know is that Salesforce has options for who can see and edit data, and your admin helps to set these up and maintain them.
With the right security enabled, your whole company can be on Salesforce, and one of the best reasons to do that is to harness the power of collaboration.

### Collaboration using Salesforce

In addition to technology for managing your sales process, Salesforce includes a platform for collaboration. You can create groups, follow people and topics, ask questions, post informal polls, share files and links, and mention colleagues with whom you’d like to connect. You can also ask questions and get answers, crowdsourcing expertise from across your company. You can find experts who can help you with overcoming objections as they come up. You can search for competitive information to help you through the negotiation stage. You can get help from your leaders and teammates as you work on steps to close.

But perhaps the best part about collaborating in Salesforce is that it’s all stored for future reference. Rather than having key insights and answers to important questions living in individual email inboxes or in hallway conversations, collaboration in Salesforce is accessible and searchable. 

And because it’s in Salesforce, this is collaboration that can happen in context, right on individual deals, tasks, support issues, and more. This is the power of collaboration combined with CRM.

### What Is CRM?

CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. This technology allows you to manage relationships with your customers and prospects and track data related to all of your interactions. It also helps teams collaborate, both internally and externally, gather insights from social media, track important metrics, and communicate via email, phone, social, and other channels.

In Salesforce, all of this information is stored securely in the cloud.

### How Salesforce Organizes Your Data

Salesforce organizes your data into objects and records. You can think of objects like a tab on a spreadsheet, and a record like a single row of data.

In Salesforce, objects are accessed via the navigation menu. Select any record to drill into a specific account, contact, opportunity, or any other record in Salesforce.

So, that’s objects, records, and more, and now you have some insight into how your data is organized in Salesforce using our spreadsheet example. But unlike an actual spreadsheet, your Salesforce data is stored in our trusted, secure cloud and has an easy-to-use interface, which you can access both from the desktop and your mobile device. So it’s similar to a spreadsheet, but in Salesforce, your data is all tracked, shared, and has apps connected to it. Salesforce comes with a set of standard objects already set up and ready for use.

### Salesforce Standard Objects
Here are some of the core standard objects you’ll be using with Salesforce, and a description of how each one is used.

* Accounts are the companies you’re doing business with. You can also do business with individual people (like solo contractors) using something called Person Accounts.
* Contacts are the people who work at an Account.
* Leads are potential prospects. You haven’t yet qualified that they are ready to buy or what product they need. You don’t have to use Leads, but they can be helpful if you have team selling, or if you have different sales processes for prospects and qualified buyers.
* Opportunities are qualified leads that you’ve converted. When you convert the Lead, you create an Account and Contact along with the Opportunity.

Salesforce CRM allows you to manage and access your data in sophisticated ways that you could never do with a simple spreadsheet. Your records can be linked together to show how your data is related, so you can see the whole picture.

## Get Started with Commerce Cloud

### What Is Commerce Cloud?

Commerce Cloud is a key part of the Salesforce Customer Success Platform and offers ecommerce solutions for B2C (business to consumer) and B2B (business to business) customers. That means that organizations purchase Commerce Cloud to provide the best ecommerce websites to their customers who are shopping online—whether they are consumers buying the latest fashion or businesses making a large wholesale purchase.

Commerce Cloud was created in July 2016, when Salesforce acquired Demandware, an industry leader in ecommerce sites and solutions designed with the shopper in mind. The Demandware technology has grown and evolved to become the Salesforce B2C Commerce product.

In 2018, Commerce Cloud expanded beyond B2C ecommerce with the acquisition of CloudCraze, a leader in ecommerce designed for organizations selling to business customers. What was CloudCraze is now the Salesforce B2B Commerce product.

Now Commerce Cloud spans across B2C and B2B to offer leading ecommerce solutions for all types of companies looking to sell products and services online.

### What Are the Commerce Cloud Products and Capabilities?

Commerce Cloud features two core capabilities: B2B Commerce and B2C Commerce.

#### B2B Commerce
Consumers aren’t the only ones buying online. Businesses need to make purchases too. For example, a wholesaler can place an order of merchandise to stock multiple stores for an entire season, or a factory can purchase replacement parts for a specific type of machine. B2B Commerce powers sites for many of the world’s largest companies that span manufacturing, consumer goods, technology, healthcare, and more.

These sites are designed for extremely large carts and purchases consisting of hundreds or thousands of items. They include B2B-specific functionality such as:

* Authenticated sites, including logins for each visitor
* Shopping carts that can accommodate hundreds of items per order
* Two-click reorders to make large, frequent orders fast and easy
* Custom storefront themes for a unique look and feel for each account
* Specific product catalogs by account for a selected subset of products
* Negotiated/contract pricing by account or by customer segment
* Complex shipping functionality allowing for multiple delivery dates and locations
* Multiple payment types like credit card, purchase order, and ACH

#### B2C Commerce

B2C Commerce lets brands create and coordinate shoppers’ online experiences and transactions across digital channels and devices. Web and mobile sites are a huge part of the online experience. Brands can launch and manage responsive ecommerce sites—for web and mobile—that have rich online storefronts, shopping cart and checkout functionalities, and full customization capabilities.

For many retailers, one site isn’t enough. When retailers have more than one brand, or when they sell in multiple countries, they typically need different sites for each brand and geography. Commerce Cloud lets retailers launch sites for multiple brands and geographies and then manage them all in a single place.

But shoppers don’t just visit web and mobile sites, they also interact with brands through email, social media, and in stores. By integrating their ecommerce sites with their marketing and service solutions, brands can make every email and social media interaction more personalized and relevant to shoppers. And by bringing ecommerce into the store through kiosks or store associate application they can provide shoppers with improved service and access to more inventory than what is available in store, often helping to “save the sale!”

##### Einstein for B2C Commerce
Einstein for B2C Commerce features are directly embedded into B2C Commerce to empower marketers and merchandisers to use AI without having to hire a data scientist. Using the wealth of their commerce data, they now have the power to make smarter decisions and supercharge personalization across commerce journeys.

Einstein intelligence powers five key B2C Commerce capabilities: Einstein Product Recommendations, Einstein Predictive Sort, Einstein Commerce Insights, Einstein Search Dictionaries, and Einstein Search Recommendations.
  
##### Order Management for B2C Commerce
Order Management for B2C Commerce gives brands full visibility into orders and inventory data. Self-service tools for shoppers, and smart up-sell and cross-sell opportunities for service agents inspire shopper loyalty and drive revenue for companies.

With Order Management, merchants can leverage the extensibility of the Salesforce Platform to design complex processes with flow, and connect effortlessly to logistics partners via the AppExchange and MuleSoft. This gives companies the flexibility to ship from anywhere, creating efficiencies that save time and money.

##### Endless Aisle for B2C Commerce
Endless Aisle for B2C Commerce provides brands with physical stores the ability to offer shoppers limitless product choice and eliminate lost sales by extending digital commerce into the store. Brands can offer to sell and ship any product to their customers, regardless of its location—helping to deliver product faster and more cost effectively. And brands can also empower store associates with real-time access to digital inventory.


### Why Does Commerce Cloud Need Different Products for B2B and B2C Commerce?

Commerce sites built for business users (B2B) are designed for a smaller set of known customers who often make large or frequent purchases. For example, a chemical manufacturer can sell to 1,000 factories that reorder each month. B2B sites need to make it easy for customers to make large orders, and then reorder the right products quickly.

Commerce sites built for the consumer (B2C)—the kind that all of us use for regular online shopping—are designed to attract a large number of guest shoppers to the site. Once a shopper is on the site, companies want to show them the most relevant products, let them quickly add a few (or several!) products to their cart, and then pay and finish the transaction quickly. It’s important for B2C sites to scale for big sales or holidays when millions of shoppers can be on the site at the same time.
